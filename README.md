# Quarterly Forecasting Forum, Autumn, 2019
This time the forum was held in University College London (UCL), London on 4th of October, 2019. There were four presentations and a discussion of the future of QFF.

1. Fergus Bolger presented on the forecasting competitions and proposed a new potential design for a competition.
2. Nikos Kourentzes discussed hierarchical forecasting methods and suggested a new reconciliation technique, involving the transformations of the original space in a simple way, involving only a handful of parameters to estimate.
3. Konstantinos Nikolopoulos presented a research related to the superforecasters by Tetlock & Gardner, testing whether the findings hold for 6 months (not 5 years) and ~200 forecasters (not 5000). He concluded that creating the superforecasters team in house is possible and could be useful in business.
4. Devon Barrow presented on stimulating data science research in Carrebean sea countries. He is applying for a research grant in that area and shared his ideas with the group.

After the presentations the group discussed the future of the QFF. The next forum will either take place in Manchester or in Lancaster. The arrangements will be done by Nikos Kourentzes and Ivan Svetunkov.
